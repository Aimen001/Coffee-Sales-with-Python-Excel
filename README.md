# Coffee-Sales-with-Python-Excel
About the Project:

This data is taken from Kaggle, it's a csv file about coffee sales with a lot of missing data. the goal from this project was to handle the missing values then to clean & analyse the data  with the EDA Method.

The project was done with Python then I exported it & build a simple Dashboard in excel. to confirm the calculations
